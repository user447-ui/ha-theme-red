**Standart Red Theme** â€” a vibrant and dynamic red theme for Home Assistant, inspired by the recovery mode. It features a convenient switch in the profile to choose between Auto, Light, and Dark modes. The **Auto** mode automatically switches based on device settings (like on your phone or PC). This theme is perfect for users who enjoy bright accents and the ability to choose the most comfortable interface.
